This file is a very drafty file used to test stuff. It contains some meeting minutes and some other stuff.

The contents aren't relevant; it's all about the parsing of the ROCK conventions.

Coding tree specifications:
  Coding trees are by definition hierarchical: there is a root with children (potentially with children of their own, and so on, with arbitrary depth). Every node in such a tree has at least an identifier, which can contain only lowercase letters, nummers, and underscores. In addition, it can have a label, which can be anything and is the human-readable name, and a code which is used to code the utterances. If a label or code is not specified, the identitier is used (for example, if the identifiers are suitable for coding, it will often not be necessary to specify both identifiers and codes; but it is possible to enable use of DCT identifiers as identifier while using codes that are more practical). Nodes can optionally have one or more children. Since only the identifier is mandatory (and copied to codes and labels if those are omitted), children can be specified using a shorthand using a list of identifiers contained between square brackets and separated by comma's.

Stanzas are not necessarily higher-level codes.

Stanzas are sets of utterances within which you want to look for code co-occurrence.

People's narratives convey information about their psychology. In their narratives,

Co-occurrences




Utterances  Sections  Stanzas  StanzaType  Strophes
---------------------------------------------------
1           1         1        A           1
2           1         1        A           1

5           2         3        A           1


Utterance = smallest unit of analysis, usually one sentence, in any case, one line (a line being defined as a set of characters ending with a line ending)

Section = a set of one or more utterances that follow each other and fall between the same two section markers ('nongreedy')

Stanza = a set of one or more utterances that occur in close proximity and that are defined by ... (the complicated bit), i.e. the smallest unit of analysis psychologically. Stanzas are a solution for the fact that peoples' sentence length is not closely related to the psychological unity of the matter they discuss. E.g. Alice could discuss her ideas about the cause of the disease in three sentences while Bob would use only one, but both explanations would be the same stanza. Stanzas are what in written text would be paragraphs. Except that spoken text is more messy, and so 'paragraphs' can be interspersed by unrelated utterances. Therefore, utterances in close proximity can be combined into the same stanza even if they are separated by a small number of unrelated utterances. Note, however, that stanzas remain defined as 'messy paragraphs'; if an interviewee starts referring back to something discussed half an hour earlier, that doesn't justify combining those utterances into the same stanza. (Note, however, that they _could_ be combined through stanza sets / strophes, if they happen to be codes by the same codes, _and_ if strophes are composed by collapsing stanzas with those codes.)

Strophe = a set of one or more stanzas that are combined based on sharing the same code, identifier, or attribute. Strophes, therefore, are collected over the entire transcript/source or over all transcripts/sources; proximity is irrelevant.

Conversation = a transcript = a source

Case = a person (assuming persons are the research unit, could in theory also be an organisation etc)

Attribute = a characteristic of a case (that can then be designated to utterances as well)

Unit = a set of one or more utterances that share a given attribute

Discourse = all utterances

Topic = a subject area discussed in the interview - i.e. topics are known beforehand and together form the interview scheme / questionnaire / whatever

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. [[inductMother>inducChild1]] [[cid=1]]
It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.[[inductFather>inducChild3]] [[cid=1]]
It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. [[inductMother>inducChild2]] [[cid=1]]

Why do we use it? [[inductMother>inducChild1]]  [[cid=1]]
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. [[inductFather>inducChild4]] [[cid=1]]
---<<A>>---
The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. [[cid=1]]
Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. [[inductFather>inducChild3]] [[cid=1]]

Where does it come from? [[inductFather>inducChild4]] [[cid=1]]
Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. [[inductFather>inducChild5]] [[cid=1]]

It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. [[Topic2]] [[cid=1]] [[tid=2]]
Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. [[tables]] [[people]] [[cid=1]]
Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. [[oaken_chests]] [[people]] [[cid=1]]
This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. [[people]] [[cid=1]]
The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. [[cid=1]]
---<<A>>---
The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

Where can I get some? [[inductFather>inducChild3]]
There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. [[chairs]] [[internet]]
If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. [[inductFather>inducChild3]]
All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. [[internet]]
It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. [[inductFather>inducChild4]] [[inductMother>inducChild1]]
The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc. [[tables]] [[att_ins_eval]]
