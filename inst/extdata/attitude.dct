    measure_dev:
      instr: Use semantic differentials with root "For me, [TARGET BEHAVIOR] is ..." and a bidimensional scale where the right-most anchor expresses a good, pleasant, beneficial, or interesting evaluation and the left-most anchor expresses the opposite bad/unpleasant/harmful/boring evaluation. The dimensions that are measured can differ depending on whatever is most relevant for the target behavior (e.g. dimensions such as unfavourable-favourable could also be used).
