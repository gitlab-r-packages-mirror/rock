The Reproducible Open Coding Kit (ROCK) was developed to facilitate reproducible and open coding, specifically geared towards qualitative research methods.

To code something with the ROCK, add the code to the line your want to code, in between twoi pairs of sqaure brackets:

```
Some example text,
and some more.       [[look_a_code]]
And the end.
```
