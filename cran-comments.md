Hey there,

0.6.3: Edited examples to run faster by selecting a sub-set of sources.

0.6.2: Caved and removed {textreader} from suggests, instead porting functions to {rock}. Also added rock::get_utterances_and_codes_from_source().

0.6.1: Implemented a check on an example for an optional (non-CRAN) package.

0.6.0: Removed the 'hard' dependency on {textreadr} as it's been archived (but hopefully will return). Also added functionality to synchronize multiple data streams.

As always, thank you for your work on CRAN!!! 🙏

Kind regards,

Gjalt-Jorn
