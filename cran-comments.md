Hey there!

Relatively minor update. Running the example for one function, 'checkPkgs()', takes too long on Windows, so added 'donttest'. Weird, though, done in a split-second here locally on Windows...

Hopefully, for the rest, smooth sailing :-)

Thank you for all your work on CRAN, kind regards,

Gjalt-Jorn
