## Reproducible Open Coding Kit

The pkgdown website for this project is located at
<https://r-packages.gitlab.io/rock>.

<!-- Start of a custom bit for every package -->

<!--------------------------------------------->

The Reproducible Open Coding Kit (ROCK, and this package, `rock`) was
developed to facilitate reproducible and open coding, specifically
geared towards qualitative research methods. Although it is a
general-purpose toolkit, three specific applications have been
implemented, specifically an interface to the `rENA` package that
implements Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA), means to process notes from
Cognitive Interviews (CIs), and means to work with a decentralized
construct taxonomy (DCT).

See the [introductory
vignette](https://r-packages.gitlab.io/rock/articles/introduction_to_rock.html)
for an introduction.

There is a FLOSS interface for the ROCK, iROCK, available at
<https://r-packages.gitlab.io/rock/iROCK/>

``` r
install.packages('rock');
```

You can install the development version of `rock` from
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com) with:

``` r

```

(assuming you have `remotes` installed; otherwise, install that first
using the `install.packages` function)
