## Reproducible Open Coding Kit

The pkgdown website for this project is located at
<https://r-packages.gitlab.io/rock>.

<!--------------------------------------------->
<!-- Start of a custom bit for every package -->
<!--------------------------------------------->

The Reproducible Open Coding Kit (ROCK, and this package, `rock`) was
developed to facilitate reproducible and open coding, specifically
geared towards qualitative research methods. Although it is a
general-purpose toolkit, three specific applications have been
implemented, specifically an interface to the `rENA` package that
implements Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA), means to process notes from
Cognitive Interviews (CIs), and means to work with a decentralized
construct taxonomy (DCT).

There is a FLOSS interface for the ROCK, iROCK, available at
<https://i.rock.science> (the accompanying git repository is available
at <https://gitlab.com/sci-ops/irock>).

We are in the process of writing a textbook to support working with the
ROCK standard, this `rock` R package, and the iROCK interface. This book
is available at <https://rockbook.org>.

Materials for a brief workshop are available through
<https://rock.science/workshop-2-hour>

## Installation

You can install the released version of `rock` from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages('rock');
```

You can install the development version of `rock` from
[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) with:

``` r
remotes::install_gitlab('r-packages/rock');
```

(assuming you have `remotes` installed; otherwise, install that first
using the `install.packages` function)

If you really want to install the most cutting edge version, install the
‘dev’ branch of this repository:

``` r
remotes::install_gitlab('r-packages/rock@dev');
```
