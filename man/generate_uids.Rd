\usage{
generate_uids(x, origin = Sys.time())
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The number of identifiers te generate.}

\item{origin}{The origin to use when generating the actual
identifiers. These identifiers are the present UNIX timestamp
(i.e. the number of seconds elapsed since the UNIX epoch,
the first of january 1970), accurate to two decimal places
(i.e. to centiseconds), converted to the base 30 system using
\code{\link[=numericToBase30]{numericToBase30()}}. By default, the present time is used as
origin, one one centisecond is added for every identifiers to
generate. \code{origin} can be set to other values to work with
different origins (of course, don't use this unless you
understand very well what you're doing!).}

\value{
A vector of UIDs.
