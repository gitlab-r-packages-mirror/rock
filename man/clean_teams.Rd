clean_teams(
  file,
  output = NULL,
  keepTime = FALSE,
  flagConfidence = TRUE,
  confFlag = c(0.7),
  preventOverwriting = rock::opts$get(preventOverwriting),
  encoding = rock::opts$get(encoding),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{output}{If not \code{NULL},
this is the name (and path) of the file in which to save the processed source (if it
\emph{is} \code{NULL}, a new file will be created with \verb{_clean} appended to the file name).}

\item{keepTime}{If true, retains the timestamp for each section at the start of the line}

\item{flagConfidence}{If true puts *** at the start of each line where the
automated transcribing is uncertain. Threshold for this flag is set by \code{confFlag}}

\item{confFlag}{sets the threshold below which a line is marked as Teams having
poor confidence in the transcription}

\item{input}{For \code{clean_teams} a path to a file that contains
the source transcription.}

\description{
This function takes a caption file from Microsoft Teams/Streams and
makes it a more readable/editable transcript.
}
\details{
This can then be proofread for transcription errors, and once ready, further
processed.

The output can be set-up to retain the time-stamps related to the recording.
If keepTime is TRUE a single timestamp (rather than a time range) starts each line.
By default, there is also a flag indicating lines where the transcription
confidence is low â€” ie they need more attention when manually cleaning.
confFlag sets the level at which lines are flagged.
